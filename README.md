## Pre session

### Find speakers who are top in their field - 
all community leaders and managers can suggest speakers for the event. Need to write a direct message to a speaker in linkedin, twitter, via email or any other platforms. Optionally is possible to arrange a zoom call to go through details, concerns, outcomes, success criterias, risks if any to include in CodeOfConduct.

need to prepare a presentation template in advance. The Canva slide template is more useful for making templates. We have to prepare slides from the template and add the speaker as a contributor in GoolgeSlide. 

### Create a register form - 
GoogleForm is suitable for it. Organizers have to include FullName, Email, Linkedin, Github(optional), Country, Any Comments fields and all other important information which has been collected from the speaker. In addition a feedback field can be added to a  GoogleForm including: what liked, disliked and how we can do better.

### Create post -

### Create event - 
after making form and post need to share this event via platforms. Share this post in Linkedin, Twitter, Slack, Meetup, include some statements which are attractive, exciting, fun as text. Share it on Monday or Tuesday.

### Create MeetingMinutes - 
use doc from template in GoogleDoc. This document should be ready before the event starts. 

### Track the registrant - 
Create Google Calendar invite including Zoom meeting ID/password at least 2 days in advance, and once reached 100 start adding to the waiting list.
